Allowlist Purpose & Rules

This domain allowlist is designed for users to copy and paste into their filtering or blocking software.
It consists only of everyday-use websites that are safe, non-explicit, and do not provide access to explicit content in any form.

Rules for Suggesting Domains

1. Search engines: Only Google and Bing are allowed.

2. No proxy or bypass sites:
  Examples: croxyproxy.com, kproxy.com, proxysite.com, etc.

3. No mixed-content platforms:
  Websites that contain unmoderated or partially moderated content are not allowed.
  Examples: reddit.com, tumblr.com, imgur.com, etc.
