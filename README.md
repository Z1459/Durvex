🛡️ About Durvex

Durvex.com is a suite of secure, privacy-focused utilities designed for power users, developers, and privacy advocates. Unlike many online tools that process data on a server, Durvex prioritizes client-side execution, ensuring your sensitive data (passwords, images, keys) never leaves your device.

🛠️ The Tool Suite

We provide a collection of lightweight, high-performance tools accessible directly from your browser:

🔐 Security & Privacy

BurnNote - Create self-destructing, password-protected notes. Content is encrypted and deleted from the server immediately upon reading.

Password Generator - Generate cryptographically strong passwords locally.

Privacy Check - Analyze your browser fingerprints and tracker exposure.

⚡ Productivity & Utilities

QR Designer - Advanced QR code generator with support for logos, gradients, and Wi-Fi/Crypto formats. Runs 100% client-side.

Data Encoder - Convert data between Base64, Hex, URL, and binary formats instantly.

Text Analysis - Real-time statistics for writers and developers.

📱 Legacy Android Projects

Durvex is also the home of several Android security projects:

Ulkrov: Advanced device owner and firewall controller.

Ulkrov Vault: Military-grade offline file encryption.

OpenPass: Open-source password manager.

DroidMDM: Android device owner app for enterprises and personal use.
